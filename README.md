# World Atlas App üåç

An interactive map of the Earth made with [D3](https://d3js.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).


Clicking on a country will retrive the corresponding Wikipedia page's summary about the country, along with the geographical coordinates and flag.
A selection of images from the country's page is also returned.
In doing that, the App uses the [Wikipedia npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wikipedia).


The globe map is freely and naturally draggable thanks to the [versor package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/versor).

This App is deployed on [Github pages](https://marcocosta1618.github.io/world-atlas-app/).

### TODO:
+ render the globe with a higher resolution topojson file and use a smaller resolution file while dragging the globe;
+ render geographical coordinates on the screen when hovering the cursor over the globe;
+ fix CORS issue;
+ mobile layout and optimizations;
+ add support for touch gestures;
+ add color schemes and color schemes switch;
+ fix tooltip width in Safari;

#### Note
At the moment some browsers won't render the Wikipedia information because of the Same Origin Policy. This will be fixed, meanwhile you can temporarily allow CORS with browser extensions (e.g., [CorsE](https://github.com/spenibus/cors-everywhere-firefox-addon) for Firefox), or disabling Cross-Origin restrictions (e.g., from the Develop menu in Safari).
