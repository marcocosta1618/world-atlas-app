# World Atlas App

An interactive map of the Earth made with [D3](https://d3js.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).


Clicking on a country will retrive the corresponding Wikipedia page's summary about the country, along with the geographical coordinates and flag.
A selection of images from the country's page is also returned.
In doing that, the App uses the [Wikipedia npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wikipedia).


The globe map is freely and naturally draggable thanks to the [versor package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/versor).

This App is deployed on [Github pages](https://marcocosta1618.github.io/world-atlas-app/).
